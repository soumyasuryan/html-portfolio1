            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>I’m a passionate and detail-oriented Software Developer with a strong foundation in computer science
                and hands-on experience in building scalable web applications and backend systems. I specialize in
                technologies such as JavaScript, Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB, and have a growing expertise in
                DevOps and cloud platforms like AWS.

                I thrive in collaborative environments, constantly seeking to learn new technologies and improve
                code quality. Whether it's designing robust APIs, building responsive UIs, or optimizing database
                queries, I aim to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

                My portfolio showcases a range of projects — from full-stack web apps to REST APIs — reflecting not
                just technical skills but also problem-solving ability, creativity, and a commitment to delivering
                high-quality software.</p>
